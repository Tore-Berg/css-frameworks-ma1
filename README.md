# css-frameworks-ma1
This is the first assignment in CSS frameworks and BEM classes. The design I were provided with was wasy enough to be recreated with just a few lines of SASS. Navigation is modified slightly, but no BEM needed. 
Will definetly use Bootstrap more in the future, due to the extreme amount of time saved.
